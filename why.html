	<p>Welcome to the #rockURconfidence website. We're so glad you stopped by to see us. Below, you'll find many images of encouragement that we have created to inspire confidence in both young girls and women around the world.</p>

	<p>We believe that every young woman should focus on the positive aspects of her life, including her body, self worth and self esteem. It's important that in today's selfie-centered world, young women feel empowered by experiences beyond being complimented for how they look.</p>

	<p>Young women everywhere are posting regular images of themselves, looking for validation from friends and strangers alike. Many girls have become all but dependent upon the "likes" of others, quickly deleting an image shared on a social network if it does not receive enough positive feedback in a given amount of time.</p>

	<p>This culture of "not good enough" is negatively impacting the self-worth our young girls have. <strong>Their identities are in others more than ever, when their identities should be in themselves.</strong></p>
